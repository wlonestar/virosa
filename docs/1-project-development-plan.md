## Development goals

To be a computer professional and technical content sharing and exchange platform, with high-quality content and a better search mechanism. The software is simple and lightweight, with a modern interface and a good interactive experience.

## Planning technology selection

The project adopts C-S/B-S architecture, covering both web and mobile terminals.

- The server is built with Spring Boot 3.x and related components, and the database is PostgreSQL

- The web site is planned to be built with React

- Mobile plans to use React Native for cross-platform development

## Development cycle

The planning time is three months (2022-12~2023-02), and it may not be finished (at the end of December), because the front-end is not familiar, you need to learn by doing, the interface may be rough at the beginning, as long as it can be used.

I am preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination next year, and the maintenance of the project may be stagnant for a period of time. Depending on the mood, it should continue to be updated.

## Developer

My humble self, the PR is not open in the early stage of the project, because this project mainly wants to exercise my ability, so I am ready to do it all by myself.

The later project has already taken shape and will open PR. I hope you can make more suggestions.
